#productivity 
For me my system must be different from other, I am not a neuro-typical guy

## System --
- strict deadlines
  // *Issue*	  
	  truly when seeing a routine or plan I give up because the idea of getting attached to that thing haunts me really bad, i had a heart break of this sort previously
  // *Solution*
	  - you cant do things half heartdly is what I think it is
	  - I have to give all it all the focus, emotion to succeed it
- Focus, Consistency
  // *Solution* 
	  - focus practice
	  - more brain usage in daily task
	  - talk and see better people
- Will of spending too much mental energy
	// *Solution*
	- better sleep
	- better recovery
	- more narrow thinking, problem solving
- Hope
- Habits

## Practice
- track every day work, attention
- posting , build in public
- vlogging
