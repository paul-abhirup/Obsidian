2025 Monthly ---
- JAN
	- [ ] cohort 1 revision
	- [ ] paytm fullstack user-app
		// did just 50% of this task didnt felt motivated
	     ### Why cant I do it?
	     *Reasons*
	     - In the previous work, many things were inter-connected and felt the need of studying prev concepts, 
	       ---> I was lazy to google out things, instead thought of do the study then comeback and again got stuck there then the loop continued
	     - High expectations on return
	     - distracted by other ideas, high dopamine activities; basically responding to temptating task untill the temptation runs out
	       // **How to deal with boaring tasks that i have procrastinated for a long time and turned boaring?**
	       // *Solution*
	       // to use high dopamine activites like nicotine,
	       energy drinks, smoking, etc
	       // use adrenaline to get through it           
	     - simply overestimated what can be done in a day vs what can be done in a month
	       **I simply spent time in collecting, planning, how to do rather than doing, practicing and hands on learning**
