- lacks in focus

adhd eres cant rely on motivation and discipline so the trad productivity dont work
external forces alows us to get the last minute deadline pressure

so you have to increase the dopamine levels
- high protien diet and working out 
- you will always cover up things in the lst minute you will never be able to do continous daily work because of the dopamine hit you get in the last minute 

------------------------------
create the last minute scenario ---
- what task you want to accomplish in the hour 
- 5 min --- planning the task
- 50 min - completing the task 
- 5 min -- reviewing 

comparing yourself with a group of high achievers

- generally put more effort yet getting a very less result 
- anxiety, hyperactivity
- always complete task last minute 
- never catch a break

- "pare a tori doba "
- creative yet lack motivation
