### Solution 
In retrospecting, I see few common grounds
- Brain
   Problems -->
	   //no control, its taking me wherever it wants
	   //no control over temptations, dont know how to react to high temptaing moments or low tepmtaing events
	   //when to focus, what to focus, why to focus
	   // win the battle, but loses the war
	   //// self-talking ////
	   // how to steer my life and soul
	   //i fear hard work
		    i think staying up late working hard, bad diet studying may cause hairfall, etc
		    //but smoking drinking, not working out eating carbs only will do nothing
		    **Time will do show its effects on the body as well as money**
	   // unable to continue a routine at any cost -- 
		   if some one says i will win a fuckin billion after doing this for a year, I will still be unable to do that ;
		   Eventually i will quite, thinking that something is good is missing out, and what not 
		// i have spent so much time unfocused that now i cant focus well in any thing
		//brute forcible work on me ,neither long term foreseeable future
		
	// **I want to forcefully make my brain do focus and manipulative and cognitive thinking task, rather than just do sitting and be unfocused in life**
	
	//*Solution
	- practicing focus
	- having strategic breaks
	- having time for unfocused thinking, self talks
	- breaking plan down to smallest possible task possible
	- nothing without force and system
	  
	  
	  **Rules --->**
	  - pomodoro time
	  - no music, or very limited only till the train has been reached its momentum
	  - most priority *focused hard work, every time brain excercise is imp --- Always quality over quantity*
	  - whenever something is a ticket to freedom, people tends to grab that oppurtunity 
	  - *ADHD people dont spend less attention, they spend more attention to many things 
	  - you have more energy both mentally and physically than normal people; just its being spent in an uncontrolled manner
	    
	    **// SYSTEM //**
	    - atleast 9 hrs workday
	    - pomodoro sessions
	    - breaking day to smallest tasks possible
	    - finding fun in what you doing, bearing the pain
	    - now shallow work, brain focus on work for the work time
	    - shallow work timings
		    - during breaks, 
		    - watching movies, 
		    - evening walks
		    - after meal 
		    - during cooking
		    - *but mindful shallow thinking, like what im thinking , why, how its changing its course*
	    - documentation of the mental thoughts, mental energy and daily time expenditure
	    - 
	
- heart
	  // I feel very compassionate and passionate about doing things that are impactful and loveing for me
	  // 

-  body
   // i want to have confidence for my body 
   // feel great about body and health
   
   
   //*solution*
   // like there is nothing more than 
   // going to gym, cardio; eating healthy most of time 
   // hair -- minoxidil, derma rolling, 


-  communication
   // idk but will figure out eventually
   // not my biggest flaw btw

-  body langauge
