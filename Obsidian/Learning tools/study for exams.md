**Understanding, Remembering, and Focusing.
1. Feynman Technique :
	- can you explain it to a collegue? Can you explain it to a 5 year old?
	- importance of understanding complex topics
	- identifying bumps !!

2. active recall: your brain is a muscle - train it by testing!

3. notes - summaryzing is controvercial.
	 Alli's theory: 
	in class
	- handwritting is better than typing
	- Helps you keep awake
	out of class
	- consolidate different sources ( he uses notion)
	- you don't need to take notes for every class
	- Cornell notetaking sistem is useful for active recall (with the help of notion for it)
	- you can turn these notes into flashcards

4. scooping the subject
- understand where the subjects fits into the bigger picture
- subcategorize the topics

	**importance of understanding 
	Coherence withing your mind

5. finding a syllabus for yourself
- you have to create a limit to your knowledge ( you can't know everything babe)
- master the syllabus rather than gather more information 

6. remembering and spaced repetition
- the more you repeat the topic, the longer it takes to forget it (but remember, it's a SPACED repetition)
- the more effort you put, you memorize better 

7. retrospective timetable on notion for revision
- you decide on the day what you are going to do
- you can do it on notion

8. spaced repetition journal
- alternate to revision timetable
- predetermined subject
- try it like: 1 week, one month

9. Interleaved repetition
- mix topics to make it harder
- brain is a muscle, making it harder to make it stronger!!!

10. rereading
- there are better ways to study, bc rereading is very passive

11. how to highlight effectively
- low utility
- helps you concentrate
- it's better to highlight than to reread something already highlighted

12. flashcards
- use anki  or google sheets
- usually it's better to make your own
- do it consistently
- isolated facts
- essay exam: you can memorize chunks of essays

// DO NOT:
- don't make flashcards of everything: only a about what you really have to know, or what you didn't get it right 
- don't make it after you only studied the subject once
- use cornell method for more information (aka easier stuff, or what u don't really need to know)

Google sheets for flashcards:
- free
- fast to create
- color code
- hide the answer putting the letters in white
- is good to do questions in order (good for clinical study of diseases)
- better to visualize the lacks of knowledge
- low commitment
- flashcards: isolated facts
Google sheets: general understanding (like whats the deal with...)

13 - mind maps
- broad understanding 
- where it rit
