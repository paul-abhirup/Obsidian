Brain Dump :
dont change track until u r in top 5%
its very distracting to jump tracks 
- dont write i will do this 3 times or 5 times to clear the concepts
- count the no of times it took to clear the concept
u have to cover the 20% highly relevant tasks that gives 80% results and get to the outcomes 

Reflection:
i cant appreciate people closer to me can be better than me
i play on luck/ chances
