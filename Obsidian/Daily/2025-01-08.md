Brain Dump :
every year for the last 2 year i am always targeting a remote job and end up fucking up the goal .
1st year it was remote internship -- although its was not bad at all 
	- i had a hell lot of fun in 1st year, football, etc
2nd year -- for it was bad as the productivity was preety fckd up
	- fucked up productivity
	- not feelong to study in college
3rd year -- 
	- 1sem its was travelling, i did study too well in the summer vac
	- rest was exam and all

now the learnings ---
- on the time I didnt feel to study i should have dive deeper into core CS topics -- CN,OS,etc
- the time should have been spent on gym, workouts, etc
- anything that is productive and gives result in the long term, yet requires lesser brain activity -- gymming, travelling, etc
- another is coping up with the *adhd* //its eats a lot of productivity, focus
- 1 thing I know about myself for sure, I outperform when I have the confidence needed for a specific, ie as the confidence builds up i perform pretty well in the field
	- so i need the confidence , build it 
- competitive spirit
- thing is that how much be the time is, always the most effective the best learning occurs in the last time / limited time duration ,although the energy and time stays high at the first
