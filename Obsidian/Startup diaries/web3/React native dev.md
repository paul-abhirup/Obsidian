The application is called Satsigner and is being developed with a grant from OpenSats and with the support of The Bitcoin Conference.

REQUIREMENTS:

- Experience with D3 or similar
- Examples of dynamic visualisation work
- Experience with React Native
- Basic understanding of bitcoin data structures
- blocks
- merkle trees
- transactions
