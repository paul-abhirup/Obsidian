Don't Let ATS Steal Your Job

1. Keyword Optimization - Extract key terms from the job posting and naturally integrate them into your resume. If a job requires "project management," don't just write "led teams" - specifically state "Managed multiple projects with cross-functional teams, overseeing project lifecycles and deliverables."
2. Job Title Alignment - Use industry-standard titles instead of creative ones. Replace "Content Guru" with "Senior Content Marketing Manager." If your current title is unique, include the standard equivalent in parentheses: "Digital Storyteller (Content Marketing Specialist)."
3. Skills Section Formatting - List skills exactly as mentioned in job postings. Instead of "Used Excel," write "Microsoft Excel (Advanced: Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP, Macros)." Group technical skills separately: "Programming: Python, Java; Design: Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator."
4. Work Experience Structure - Format each entry consistently: Company Name | Job Title | Location | Dates. Example: "Amazon | Senior Product Manager | Seattle, WA | 01/2020 - Present." Follow with bullet points describing achievements using job-posting keywords.
5. Achievement Quantification - Transform vague statements into measurable results. Instead of "Improved sales," write "Increased quarterly sales by 45% through implementation of new CRM system, resulting in $2.5M additional revenue.
6. Acronym Management - First mention should include both full term and acronym: "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)" or "Master of Business Administration (MBA)." Subsequent mentions can use acronym only: "Implemented SEO strategies."
7. Section Headers - Use clear, standard section headers: "Professional Experience," "Education," "Skills," "Certifications." Avoid creative alternatives like "Career Journey" or "Learning Path." Make headers slightly larger but in the same font.
8. Job Description Mirroring - When job posts "must have experience in Salesforce," your resume should state "5+ years of Salesforce experience in enterprise environments," not just "CRM experience."
9. Experience Hierarchy - List most relevant experience first. If applying for marketing, move marketing achievements to top bullet points, even if they were just 20% of your role.
10. Achievement Formula - Use the PAR format: Problem + Action + Result. For example: "Identified declining sales (Problem), implemented automated CRM system (Action), resulting in 40% revenue increase (Result)."
